# Splasher


## Getting Started

To get started with **Splasher** locally, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   First, clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Luncy-May/Splasher.git
   cd Splasher
   ```

2. **Set Up the Client**

   Navigate to the `client` directory and install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled react-markdown react-icons
   ```

3. **Set Up the Server**

   Next, navigate back to the root of the project, and then into the `server` directory to install the server dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd ..
   cd server
   npm install cors express dotenv axios
   ```

### Running the Application

To run the project locally, you'll need to open **two terminals** — one for the client and one for the server.

#### Terminal 1: Start the Client

1. Navigate to the `client` directory:

   ```bash
   cd client
   ```

2. Run the client using:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

This will start the React development server on the client side.

#### Terminal 2: Start the Server

1. Navigate to the `server` directory:

   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

2. Run the server using:

   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

This will start the backend server for Splasher.
